## Usage

### `saws-logs-open-log-group`

Prompts the user for a log group and a relative time, and sticks output in a prettified buffer:

![saws-logs-open-log-group](https://github.com/LaurenceWarne/prefab.el/assets/17688577/53ea7508-65c5-4d0e-9d6c-1b84626118ed)

`?` can be used to view keybindings available in the log buffer.
